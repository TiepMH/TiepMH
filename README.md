    - Using MUSIC Algorithm (will be available soon)
    - [Using cross-correlation](https://github.com/TiepMH/TimeDelayEstimation):
      This method is very useful for highly correlated signals. Cross-correlation is a popular method of estimating time delays in WiFi and 5G NR. For example, in Matlab 5G Toolbox, the built-in function ``nrTimingEstimate`` is built based on performing cross-correlation.

 * #### Positioning in 5G NR
   - Using PRS (positioning reference signal) in the downlink:
  
     Different gNBs transmit PRS to a user (UE) in the **downlink**. On the UE side, the received waveform can be used to estimate the time of arrivals (TOAs).
     Each gNB corresponds to a different TOA. As for the UE, it can employ TOAs to localize its position.
     The following three examples present how to estimate TOAs on the UE side.
     
     [Example 1: PRS-based Delay Estimation, Downlink, SISO channel](https://github.com/TiepMH/5G-NR-Positioning/blob/main/find_Delays_by_using_PRS_in_SISO_channel.m)
     
     [Example 2: PRS-based Delay Estimation, Downlink, MISO channel](https://github.com/TiepMH/5G-NR-Positioning/blob/main/find_Delays_by_using_PRS_in_MISO_channel.m)

     [Example 3: PRS-based Delay Estimation, Downlink, MIMO channel](https://github.com/TiepMH/5G-NR-Positioning/blob/main/find_Delays_by_using_PRS_in_MIMO_channel.m)

   - Using SRS (sounding reference signal) in the uplink:
  
     SRS can be used for positioning purposes on the **uplink**, from an UE to a gNB. When the UE transmits SRS to the gNB, the gNB uses the received waveform to estimate TOA. If a network has at least three collaborative gNBs, they can rely on TOAs to localize the UE's position.
